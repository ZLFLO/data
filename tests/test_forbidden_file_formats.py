    Find all files with given extensions in a folder, case-insensitive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder : Path
        Path object representing the folder to search in
    extensions : Set[str]
        Set of file extensions to search for (with or without leading dot)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> files = find_files_by_extension(Path("./data"), {".csv", "txt"})
    >>> # Will find files like: example.csv, EXAMPLE.CSV, data.TXT
    >>> print(files[0])

    -----
    The search is case-insensitive, so it will find both lowercase and uppercase

    Notes
    -----
    GeoJSON is preferred over shapefiles and geopackages because:

    - Works better with version control
    - Single file format instead of multiple files (like shapefiles)
